                                    <p>I have worked construction mainly for the past 5 years.  I have always been rather big 200Lbs/90.72kg+ since high school.  It made work easier in some aspects but was not a healthy spot to be in.  Back in april of 2017 I hit my highest weight I had ever been (252Lbs/114.31kg) and I ended up with a stomach ulcer.  I went to a doctor and they ended up prescribing me Dexilant.  This medication made me feel horrid so I spent time researching alternative treatments for ulcers.  This was when i first came across IF/Keto.  I did a keto diet for about a month and lost 5lbs/23.13kg but with Dexilant it made staying on anything hard as I couldn't keep food down.  It was at that time I decided to do a long term fast.  I started with a 21 day fast and did water only, I did not document any of it only that i ended up at 230Lbs/104.33kg after the fast.  The fast ended up repairing my gut and my ulcer basically went away after that.  I felt fine that entire time and didn't even supplement with much salt or vitamins.  Fast forward to July 17th at 6 am, I read a few of the posts here about people going 40-70 days on a fast and decided I would try to do as long of a fast as I can.  I suppose the reasoning for this fast is mainly weight loss but also to see how long I can go and to test my mental fortitude.  21 days for me seemed easy enough and I have the fat to make it longer term.  Note: Prior to starting this fast I did a strict keto diet for 3 weeks with 10net grams of carbs or less, meaning I was in ketosis and fat adapted prior to starting this fast (most likely why you do not see a huge drop in water weight at the beginning on my weight charts).</p>
