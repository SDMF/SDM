Hello everyone, I am excited to fully document this journey.  I have seen multiple users from this community post their experiences in-depth and I decided I would also share my experience.

&nbsp;

**About Me:**

I have worked construction mainly for the past 5 years.  I have always been rather big 200Lbs/90.72kg+ since high school.  It made work easier in some aspects but was not a healthy spot to be in.  Back in april of 2017 I hit my highest weight I had ever been (252Lbs/114.31kg) and I ended up with a stomach ulcer.  I went to a doctor and they ended up prescribing me Dexilant.  This medication made me feel horrid so I spent time researching alternative treatments for ulcers.  This was when i first came across IF/Keto.  I did a keto diet for about a month and lost 5lbs/23.13kg but with Dexilant it made staying on anything hard as I couldn't keep food down.  It was at that time I decided to do a long term fast.  I started with a 21 day fast and did water only, I did not document any of it only that i ended up at 230Lbs/104.33kg after the fast.  The fast ended up repairing my gut and my ulcer basically went away after that.  I felt fine that entire time and didn't even supplement with much salt or vitamins.  Fast forward to July 17th at 6 am, I read a few of the posts here about people going 40-70 days on a fast and decided I would try to do as long of a fast as I can.  I suppose the reasoning for this fast is mainly weight loss but also to see how long I can go and to test my mental fortitude.  21 days for me seemed easy enough and I have the fat to make it longer term.  Note: Prior to starting this fast I did a strict keto diet for 3 weeks with 10net grams of carbs or less, meaning I was in ketosis and fat adapted prior to starting this fast (most likely why you do not see a huge drop in water weight at the beginning on my weight charts).

&nbsp;

**Goals:**

*-Goal 1: Weight loss*

Ideally I would like to fast until I hit 170-180Lbs/77.11kg-81.65(starting at 233.4Lbs/105.87kg). That would be a net loss of 50-60Lbs/22.68-27.22kg.

&nbsp;

*-Goal 2: Loose Skin*

If I were to drop this much weight I would like a secondary goal to be no loose skin.

&nbsp;

*-Goal 3: Stretch Marks*

I have a few stretch marks on my abdomen but realistically I do not think fasting will remove those, at best the color will fade or they will be slightly less noticeable once my fast is completed and my skin isn't stretched so much, these will just end up being a reminder to keep my health in check in the future.

&nbsp;

*-Goal 4: Lipomas*

I have several Lipomas under my skin in various places.  These are just fatty subcutanious tissues that pose no threat to health.  I have read that 21+ day fasts can reduce the size of these and in some cases make them dissapear entirely.

I know people say not to drink tap, however I live in the countryside and the water from the well I drink is only treated with chlorine.  I use two stage particulate filters down to 15 microns, then single stage carbon filter to 5 microns.  After that I filter it further with my brita water pitcher (generic carbon filter).  That removes any chlorine left.  The only fluoride in the water is naturally occurring.  I can taste the plastic in all the bottled water I have tried so I will stick to my well water tap.
